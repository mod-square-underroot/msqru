    <h1>Stuck</h1>

    <p> <em>
     How big can a room be? 
And how empty, and cold, and white?</em>
</p>
<p>
I think to myself as I stare at the ceiling, lying flat on the ground, not intending to move a muscle. My back is nearly the same temperature as the floor beneath it, my feet and arms spread as wide as they’ll go. Even the back of my neck is pressed fully against the ground. 

And who made this building like this, anyway? 

I can hear buzzing voices coming from the two rooms inside. How lavish they sound, full of people. Of chatter, movement, color, warmth. I almost feel bad for the one I am in. </p>
<p><em>God, am I attached to a room now?</em></p>
 
<p>
Moving out won't erase its existence, as this is not a room. 
<br>
This is the lobby.
<br>
The place everyone checks in before they are moved to their own rooms of choice. So I am not doing it out of kindness, or any sense of agency on behalf of the lobby itself. I don't even want to talk to the receptionist. She sweet-talks people into one room or the other. 

It's not that I'm incapable of getting into a room. It's just, sometimes, you cannot, because you really just do not know. I mean you still can, but it defeats the whole purpose. It isn't real. It's just convenient. 

Everyone entering the lobby stares at me in caution as they proceed to their chosen room. I've been here for quite some time now. I can't even recall. 

The receptionist has changed a few times. So has the guard at the door. 

The rules of the place are simple: enter the lobby and choose one room—- the trusting, or the distrusting.  Once you choose, you settle in, able to access the services they provide.

You can switch rooms. You can be taken out of a room and placed into the other one, or, if something fractures in your head, you break out by tearing apart the wall, since the lock on the doors is too tricky to try. 

"Crazy, " they go when one of them does that, not knowing they might be next.  Returning to the lobby is dreaded, though not impossible.
 
I am not aware how long it’s been in the outer world, but here, well, time runs differently.

      <em>Just how quiet can a room be?
And how ridiculously unfeeling?</em>
